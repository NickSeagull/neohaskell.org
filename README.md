# NeoHaskell website

Astro + Starlight, with a custom homepage and static documentation. Local builds target `https://neohaskell.org`. GitHub Actions publishes a preview at `https://nickseagull.dev/neohaskell.org/`. GitHub redirects `https://nickseagull.github.io/neohaskell.org/` there because the account's Pages site uses a custom domain.

## Run locally

Use Node.js 24 (or Node.js 22.23.4+).

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev -- --port 4323 --background --force
```

`npm run build` checks Astro/TypeScript and generates `dist/`. `npm run preview` serves that production build. `npm test` verifies campaign-context handling, the illustrative order model, and stable documentation links and anchors.

During documentation authoring, keep one server at `http://127.0.0.1:4323`. Restart it after every completed batch of changes, before browser verification and sharing the URL. An existing process can serve updated MDX while retaining an older Starlight configuration.

Use the project's maintained commands to stop the registered servers, run applicable checks, then start the one development server:

```sh
npm run preview -- stop
npm run dev -- stop
npm run build
npm run dev -- --port 4323 --background --force
```

`npm run dev -- status` identifies the active process and URL. Check listening processes as well when cleaning up duplicates: confirm a process belongs to this repository by its working directory and command before terminating it. For an unregistered server without a maintained stop command, use SIGTERM on its verified PID. Preserve other projects' servers. If port 4323 is occupied, resolve ownership instead of accepting a new port or using `--ignore-lock`.

Check the rendered sidebar against `astro.config.mjs` and inspect the changed content on the same development URL. A build needs no second preview server, and verification on a different origin cannot establish what the owner sees. If production serving is explicitly needed, stop development first and restore the single development server afterward.

## Main files

- `src/components/Home.astro`: shared homepage, navigation, and theme control for every language.
- `src/components/HomepageVisual.astro`: static application, event-history, pure-decision, and transport illustrations.
- `src/styles/home.css`: selected workshop identity in both themes.
- `src/content/docs/`: MDX guides for core concepts and installation/agent setup.
- `src/scripts/attribution.ts`: optional, screened five-field UTM context; same-origin navigation only, per-tab storage with a 30-minute expiry. No analytics service or durable backend events.

The homepage has no tutorial widget, replay control, scenario switcher, or concept-step interaction. Documentation teaches the vocabulary before AI-agent setup. The setup page includes a source-verified agent-skills command and links to the upstream framework environment instructions.

## Documentation

Start at `/introduction/`, then read `/introduction/history/`, `/learn/`, and `/introduction/event-modeling/` for the four introductory lessons. Installation and agent setup live separately under `/getting-started/`. The pages use Starlight's native topic sidebar, title, search, contents outline, anchor navigation, and code copying. Sidebar sections start expanded. The article scrolls normally, with examples and diagrams beside the relevant explanation.

`/resources/` collects verified setup, language/framework guidance, project status, releases, and community destinations. The setup guide distinguishes application preparation from agent-skills installation; it is not a verified zero-to-running-app walkthrough.

Author English content in `src/content/docs/`. Reading styles live in `src/styles/docs.css`; prose is 18px and code/table examples are 16px. Shared lesson components live in `src/components/learn/`, including the event-history replay, Event Model, growth charts, and IDE screenshot. Code snippets illustrate the lesson and are not standalone applications. Use `learning-example-review` as required by `AGENTS.md` when creating or materially changing examples.

## Translation workflow

Use Starlight's native language folders. English lives in `src/content/docs/`; a Spanish translation of `introduction/history/index.mdx` lives in `src/content/docs/es/introduction/history/index.mdx`. The configured languages are listed in `src/i18n/locales.mjs`. Missing pages use [Starlight's English fallback](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/i18n/#fallback-content).

Ask an agent to update named pages in named languages, for example: “Update the Spanish and French translations of Events and history using the latest English changes.” There is no bulk translation command, manifest, or freshness gate.

1. Read the English page, its relevant Git diff, `GLOSSARY.md`, and the existing translations. Limit the work to the requested pages and languages. Page plans are outside the default translation scope. A glossary edit is guidance for relevant passages, not an instruction to regenerate every language.
2. Edit each translated file directly. Preserve human corrections and translate only the changed passages, with the full page as context. Keep executable code, imports, component props, URL destinations, and stable anchors intact. Translate prose, headings, titles, descriptions, and sidebar labels naturally; grammar and emphasis need not follow English node order. Update only the affected keys in shared catalogs when the request includes diagram or interface text.
3. Review the diff, including code blocks and links, then run `npm run build`. Inspect the affected page and any changed shared component. Technical checks do not certify linguistic accuracy. A copy edit does not require another review of every language.

Documentation links are relative, such as `../history/#record-what-happened`. They preserve the selected language and deployment base, including on fallback pages. Headings with shared links keep an explicit anchor:

```mdx
## Recorded facts <a id="record-what-happened" />
```

The small `remark-stable-headings.mjs` plugin moves that marker's ID onto the heading. It does not read another document or compare heading counts. Preserve the ID when translating, renaming, or moving a section; new headings without a marker use Astro's normal generated IDs.

Homepage and diagram strings remain in `src/i18n/<locale>/site.json`; custom documentation controls live in `src/content/i18n/<lang>.json`. Missing site-catalog keys fall back to English. Reuse existing keys and the `@components/` imports. Keep literal IDE labels and code identifiers when describing the actual English screenshot or code.

English changes do not block publication. Existing translations remain editable and available while their updates are reviewed. Git diffs and editorial review track that work; there is no automatic stale-translation detection. If an outdated translation is misleading, deliberately remove that page from published content to use the English fallback. Existing translated page plans are retained, but are not automatically refreshed.

## Deployment

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs tests and the normal build on every push to `main` or manual dispatch, then publishes to the GitHub Pages project URL. CI does not translate content or require all languages to be synchronized. Publication remains paused by owner direction; do not push until publication is requested again. The preview build uses `/neohaskell.org/` as its base path and omits the production `CNAME` and `robots.txt` files from the artifact. Local builds still use `https://neohaskell.org` without a base path. To reproduce the preview build locally, run `GITHUB_PAGES_PREVIEW=true npm run build`.

## Assets and design

The original NeoHaskell logo is preserved in `public/logo.svg`. Sansation, Manrope, and Pixelify Sans are self-hosted; their open-font licenses are included in `public/fonts/`. Font sources: Google Fonts and its `google/fonts` repository. No generated raster artwork ships in the site.

`GLOSSARY.md` defines canonical vocabulary. The approved scope and direction contract are in `.impeccable/surfaces/src-pages-index-astro.md`. Earlier studies under `.impeccable/diagrams/` are review artifacts, not website features.

See [the design artifact policy](.impeccable/README.md) for what is committed from `.impeccable/`. Shared design records and approved references are versioned; generated captures, caches, logs, and unused explorations stay local.

## Agent quality standard

`AGENTS.md` applies the project-local [Unslop skill](.agents/skills/unslop/SKILL.md) to every task. Unslop is by [Damir Sokolovsky (@heydamir)](https://github.com/heydamir/unslop), licensed under CC BY 4.0. Its [installation record](.agents/skills/unslop/UPSTREAM.md) pins the source revision and documents browser tooling. After `npm ci`, run `npx playwright install chromium` to enable its snapshots.
